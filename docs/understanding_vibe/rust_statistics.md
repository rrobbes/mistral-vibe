# Mistral Vibe — Rust Codebase Analysis

Last updated: 2026-10-19 (v2.26.1)

Deep-dive into the Rust side of the codebase, mirroring the Python analysis in `statistics.md`.

## Overview

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total Rust files | **794** |
| Total Rust LOC | **153,857** |
| Source files (`src/`) | 560 |
| Source LOC | 119,347 |
| Test files | 234 |
| Test LOC | 34,510 |
| Avg lines/file (source) | 213 |
| Avg lines/file (all) | 194 |
| Test-to-source ratio (lines) | **0.29:1** |

Two crates: `vibe-rs` (Ratatui TUI) and `harness-core` (app-server harness).

## Crate Breakdown

| Crate | Path | Files | LOC | Source LOC | Test LOC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `vibe-rs` (Ratatui TUI) | `vibe/cli-rust/` | 650 | 102,163 | 67,653 | 34,510 |
| `harness-core` (app-server harness) | `harness/core/` | 144 | 51,694 | 35,323 | 16,371 |

## Code Density (source only, 119,347 lines)

| Category | Lines | % |
|---|---|---|
| Blank lines | 8,604 | 7.2% |
| Line comments (`//`) | 8,340 | 7.0% |
| Doc comments (`///`) | 5,626 | 4.7% |
| Module doc comments (`//!`) | 612 | 0.5% |
| Block comment starts (`/*`) | 9 | <0.1% |
| Actual code | ~96,156 | 80.6% |

Compared to Python source (82.5% code, 13.3% blank, 2.8% comments), Rust source is denser: fewer blank lines, more comments (especially doc comments at 4.7% vs Python docstrings at 1.4%).

## Language Constructs (source only)

| Construct | Count |
|---|---|
| `struct` declarations | 417 |
| `enum` declarations | 173 |
| `trait` declarations | 4 |
| `impl` blocks | 359 |
| `async fn` declarations | 145 |
| `#[derive(...)]` attributes | 649 |
| `pub use` re-exports | 86 |
| `macro_rules!` definitions | 1 |
| `unsafe` blocks (files containing) | 11 files, 39 mentions |

Notable: only 4 traits and 1 macro definition — the codebase favors concrete types and enums over trait-based abstraction. `unsafe` usage is minimal (11 files out of 560).

## File Size Distribution

### Source files (560 files)

| Bucket | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| < 20 lines | 23 | 4% |
| 20–50 lines | 60 | 11% |
| 50–100 lines | 111 | 20% |
| 100–200 lines | 160 | 29% |
| 200–500 lines | 165 | 29% |
| > 500 lines | 42 | 7% |

### Test files (234 files)

| Bucket | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| < 20 lines | 7 | 3% |
| 20–50 lines | 46 | 20% |
| 50–100 lines | 55 | 24% |
| 100–200 lines | 69 | 29% |
| 200–500 lines | 64 | 27% |
| > 500 lines | 18 | 8% |

Rust files skew larger than Python: the modal bucket is 100–500 lines (58% of source files), vs Python's modal bucket of 50–200 lines (37%).

## Observations

1. **Harness dominates by LOC-per-file**: harness-core averages 246 lines/file (source) vs vibe-rs at 163 lines/file. The harness is denser, more logic-heavy code; the TUI is more spread across many small widget files.
2. **`v8.rs` is the single largest Rust file** at 3,646 lines — nearly 3x the next largest source file. It's a V8 JavaScript engine binding for code-mode tool execution and is an extreme outlier.
3. **UI is the biggest TUI module**: `ui/` at 108 files / 16K lines is 24% of all TUI source. Transcript rendering (3.2K lines) and markdown highlighting (2K lines) are the two biggest sub-areas.
4. **Low trait usage**: Only 4 trait definitions across 560 source files. The codebase favors enums and concrete types over trait-based polymorphism — a pragmatic choice for a CLI app.
5. **Minimal `unsafe`**: 11 files out of 560 use `unsafe` (39 mentions total). The V8 bindings and possibly FFI for audio/terminal are the likely hotspots.
6. **Acceptance scenarios are the biggest test category** in harness-core: 14 files / 9.8K lines of end-to-end behavior tests, reflecting the harness's role as a testable app-server backend.
7. **Async is pervasive but not dominant**: 145 `async fn` declarations across 560 source files (~26%). The TUI uses tokio for the event loop; the harness is more synchronous with targeted async for I/O.
8. **Rust test ratio is lower than Python**: 0.29 test lines per source line vs Python's 1.37:1. However, Rust's 1,835 test functions across 234 test files is still substantial coverage, and Rust's type system catches more errors at compile time.
